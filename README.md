# COEN12
Codebase of Labs done for my Algorithms and Data Structures course at SCU-2017. The code is written in C or C++ and implements some abstract data types and also some data structure "goodies" like Huffman Coding.

In each project folder you will find all the files needed from each project, including C/C++ files given to us by our instructor. These were not written by me, but used as an acessory to our labs. Such files are used to do things like print out the maze to the screen as in Project 4, and in them you will see someone elses name at the top.

Almost all the labs have the associated project assignment in them, excpet projects 1 and two. In those, they are probably simple enough to figure out what they are doing.
